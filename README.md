[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/GeDS)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GeDS) ![downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/GeDS)

Geometrically Designed Spline ('GeDS') Regression is a non-parametric geometrically motivated method for fitting variable knots spline predictor models in one or two independent variables, in the context of generalized (non-)linear models. 'GeDS' estimates the number and position of the knots and the order of the spline, assuming the response variable has a distribution from the exponential family. A description of the method can be found in [Kaishev et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00180-015-0621-7) and [Dimitrova et al. (2017)](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/18460).
